## Azure Global Infrastructure

### Data Center
<pre>
  Physical facility
  Hosting for group of networked servers
  Own power, cooling & networking infrastructure

### Region
<pre>
Geographical area on the planet
One but usually more datacenters connected with low-latency network (<2 milliseconds)
Location for your services
Some services are available only in certain regions
Some services are global services, as such are not assigned/deployed in specific region
Globally available with 50+ regions
Special government regions (US DoD Central, US Gov Virginia, etc.)
Special partnered regions (China East, China North)

### Availability Zone
<pre>
Regional feature
Grouping of physically separate facilities
Designed to protect from data center failures
If zone goes down others continue working
Two service categories
  Zonal services (Virtual Machines, Disks, etc.)
  Zone-redundant services (SQL, Storage, etc.)
Not all regions are supported
Supported region has three or more zones
A zone is one or more data centers

### Region Pair
<pre>
Each region is paired with another region making it a region pair
Region pairs are static and cannot be chosen
Each pair resides within the same geography*
  Exception is Brazil South
Physical isolation with at least 300 miles distance (when possible)
Some services have platform-provided replication
Planned updates across the pairs
Data residency maintained for disaster recovery
 </pre>
 
 ### Geographies
<pre>
Discrete market
Typically contains two or more regions
Ensures data residency, sovereignty, resiliency, and compliance requirements are met
Fault tolerant to protect from region wide failures
Broken up into areas
  Americas
  Europe
  Asia Pacific
  Middle East and Africa
Each region belongs only to one Geography
